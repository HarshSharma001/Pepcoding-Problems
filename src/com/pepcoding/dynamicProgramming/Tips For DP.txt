For Memoization :

* If you're going to write a memoized code, then don't go for memoization directly.
  Instead first write down a recursive code, and then by euler graph, try to analyse the spot
  at which your recursive code is solving same problems again and again.

  And for that, use a medium length testcase, so that you can verify with more clarity,
  where your code should get optimized.

  And then apply memoization to your code...


* If you're going for tabulation, then follow these steps :

    1) Define Storage & assign meaning to the dp table

    2) Define Direction - where are smaller problems and where are larger problems

                          cause we'll solve from smaller problems to larger problems

    3) Travel & Solve - from the smallest problem to the largest problem
